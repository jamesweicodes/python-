/*
Another important statistic for assessing risk is the correlation between the returns of two assets. Correlation is a measure of how closely two datasets are associated with each other. It is often represented by the correlation coefficient, which is a value that ranges between -1 and 1. This indicates whether there is a positive correlation, negative correlation, or no correlation:

Positive correlation – when the rate of return of one asset deviates upward from its mean, the other usually deviates upward as well.

Negative correlation – when the rate of return of one asset deviates upward from its mean, the other usually deviates downward.

No correlation – when a change in one asset’s rate of return does not dictate a change in another. The correlation coefficient will be close to 0.
