/*
If an employee worked for more than 40 hours, she needs to be paid overtime (1.5 times the normal hourly wage).

For instance, if an employee worked for 43 hours and made $10/hour, she would receive $400 for the first 40 hours that she worked, and an additional $45 for the 3 hours of overtime, for a total for $445.

Create a lambda function total_earned that accepts an input row with keys hours_worked and hourly_wage and uses an if statement to calculate the hourly wage.
