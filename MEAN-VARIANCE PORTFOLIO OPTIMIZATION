Review
In this lesson, you learned how to find the efficient frontier â€“ a set of portfolios that minimizes risk and maximizes expected return. You also learned:

How to calculate the weight of each asset in a portfolio, and use them to calculate the expected return of the portfolio
Why the covariance matrix is important for evaluating the risk of a portfolio, and how to calculate it using Pandas
How to use a function that returns portfolios from a wide range of mean-variance combinations for a given set of assets
How to plot the entire range of possible mean-variance combinations for a given set of assets
Where the efficient frontier falls on the mean-variance plot and why it falls there
That adding an uncorrelated asset will decrease the risk of portfolios on the efficient frontier
