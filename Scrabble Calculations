/*
We have provided you with two lists, letters and points. We would like to combine these two into a dictionary that would map a letter to its point value.

Using a list comprehension and zip, create a dictionary called letter_to_points that has the elements of letters as the keys and the elements of points as the values.

player_to_points should now contain the mapping of players to how many points they’ve scored. Print this out to see the current standings for this game!

If you’ve calculated correctly, wordNerd should be winning by 1 point.
