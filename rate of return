Simple Rate of Return
Now that we are familiar with how the rate of return is usually expressed, let’s take a look at calculating it.

The most basic type of return is the simple rate of return. It is defined as the difference between the starting and ending price of an investment over a time period, divided by the starting price. If an investment returns dividends, those dividends should be added to the numerator.

R = \frac{E - S + D}{S}R= 
S
E−S+D
​	 
R: simple rate of return
S: starting price of investment
E: ending price of investment
D: dividend
