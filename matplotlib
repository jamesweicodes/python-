Review
Now you’ve played around with several two-dimensional line plots in Matplotlib. You’ve seen how you can create simple, readable plots with few commands. You’ve also learned some commands to style and label your plots better. These are the concepts you’ve seen in Matplotlib so far:

Creating a line graph from data
Changing the appearance of the line
Zooming in on different parts of the axis
Putting labels on titles and axes
Creating a more complex figure layout
Adding legends to graphs
Changing tick labels and positions
Saving what you’ve made

import codecademylib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

x = range(6)
y1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
y2 = [-1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4]

plt.plot(x, y1, marker='o', color='pink')
plt.plot(x, y2, marker='o', color='gray')

plt.title("Two Lines on One Graph")
plt.xlabel("Amazing X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Incredible Y-axis")

plt.legend(["Y1","Y2"], loc=4)

plt.show()
